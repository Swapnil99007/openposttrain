## Decision 002: Use YAML configs for evaluation runs

### Decision

Evaluation runs will be configured through YAML files instead of hardcoded script values.

### Reason

This makes experiments reproducible and easier to compare.

A single runner can support multiple models and benchmarks by changing config files.

### Alternatives Considered

- Hardcode model and benchmark settings in each script.
- Use only command-line arguments.
- Use Python config files.

### Tradeoff

YAML configs add slightly more structure upfront, but make the project cleaner as the number of experiments grows.

### Status

Accepted.
